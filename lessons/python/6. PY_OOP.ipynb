This has a conventional meaning in Python which is formally implemented in other languages, the notion of a private function.  Classes are used to encapsulate functionality and data while providing an interface to the outside world of other objects.  Think of a program as a company, each worker has their own responsibilities and they know that other people the company perform certain tasks, but they don't necessary know how those people perform those tasks.  \n","\n","In order to make this possible, Classes have both public and private methods.  Public methods are methods which are exposed to other objects or user interaction.  Private methods are used internally to the object, often in a \"helper\" sense.  In some languages this notion of public and private methods is enforced and the programmer will have to specify every method as either public or private.  In Python every method is public, but to distinguish which methods we mean to be private, we add an underscore to the front of the method, hence `_gcd`.  This is a note to someone using the class that this method should only be called inside the object and can be subject to change with new versions, whereas the public methods will hopefully not change their interface.\n","\n","Another Python convention dealing with underscores are the so called `dunder` methods which have double underscores before and after the method names.  There are a bunch of these in Python `__init__, __name__, __add__`, etc and they have special meaning.  Note that they are generally considered private methods as well except in special circumstances.  In the case of methods like `__add__`, they are what allow the programmer to specify the `+` operation.  Since these method have special meaning to Python they should only be used with care.  Additionally, even though overloading things like the `+` operator might make sense to you as you program it, it can very confusing to someone reading your code as Python's dynamic type system usually does not allow determination of types until runtime, usually defining an `.add` method is much more clear.\n","\n","## When do we want Classes?\n","\n","When we want to perform a set of related tasks, especially in repetition, we will usually want to define a new class.
